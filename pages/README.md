# PAGES

* This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
* The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.
* Naming convention under this folder should be lowercase. All main code should be written under components directory.
* Make different components folders for pages and code should be divided into small parts to make optimisation easy.  

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing).
